# Olympic Team Selector
This C++ project allows users to select and manage their dream team for the Olympics. The team consists of athletes from three sports: Skating, 100-Meter Sprint, and Archery. Users can add, remove, and rank athletes based on their performances in the Olympic trials and medals won. The project uses templates, operator overloading, and custom data structures like doubly linked lists to efficiently manage the athlete data.

## Features
- Custom Doubly Linked List Template: Manages dynamic collections of athletes from different sports.
- Operator Overloading: Allows comparison, ranking, and output of athlete objects in an intuitive manner.
- Multiple Sports Support: Manages athletes in Skating, 100-Meter Sprint, and Archery, each with different performance metrics.
- Encapsulation: Protects the internal data of each athlete while allowing controlled interaction through well-defined public interfaces.
